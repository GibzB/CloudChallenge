# ☁️ CloudChallenges 
My cloud computing learning journey. My hope is to encourage you to build secure, scalable, highly available and cost-effective cloud applications. 

### DataProc
Cloud Dataproc is a fast, easy-to-use, fully-managed cloud service for running Apache Spark and Apache Hadoop clusters in a simpler, more cost-efficient way. 
Learnt how to use the Cloud Console to create and update a Dataproc cluster and then submit a job in that cluster.

### BQML (Big Query Machine Language)
BigQuery is Google's fully managed, NoOps, low cost analytics database where you can query terabytes and terabytes of data without having any infrastructure to manage or needing a database administrator. BQ uses SQL and can take advantage of the pay-as-you-go model and it also allows you to focus on analyzing data to find meaningful insights.
Big Query Machine Learning (BQML, product in beta) is a new feature in BigQuery where data analysts can create, train, evaluate, and predict with machine learning models with minimal coding.

### Google Cloud Billing Reports
I learned how to use Google Cloud Billing reports and the cost breakdown report to gain visibility into your current and forecasted costs!
