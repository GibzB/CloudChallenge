# ☁️ CloudChallenges 
My cloud computing learning journey. My hope is to encourage you to build secure, scalable, highly available and cost-effective cloud applications. 

### DataProc
Cloud Dataproc is a fast, easy-to-use, fully-managed cloud service for running Apache Spark and Apache Hadoop clusters in a simpler, more cost-efficient way. 
Learnt how to use the Cloud Console to create and update a Dataproc cluster and then submit a job in that cluster.

### BQML (Big Query Machine Language)
BigQuery is Google's fully managed, NoOps, low cost analytics database where you can query terabytes and terabytes of data without having any infrastructure to manage or needing a database administrator. BQ uses SQL and can take advantage of the pay-as-you-go model and it also allows you to focus on analyzing data to find meaningful insights.
Big Query Machine Learning (BQML, product in beta) is a new feature in BigQuery where data analysts can create, train, evaluate, and predict with machine learning models with minimal coding.

### Google Cloud Billing Reports
I learned how to use Google Cloud Billing reports and the cost breakdown report to gain visibility into your current and forecasted costs!
Google Cloud Billing reports, provides built-in cost reporting for GCP within the Google Cloud Console. Billing reports can be viewed from a live billing account and in that case understanding current and forecasted GCP costs, which then can be analyzed in relation to costs using report filters to identify cost drivers and trends.
I explored a sample of Cloud Billing records in BigQuery. After examining the sample dataset and table, I composed and ran queries on the billing data.

### DataFlow & Apache Beam
All provide templates, for streaming, batch and utility

### Looker & Google Data Studio
Has lookML, and is 100% web based
have many data visualisations, and shared through various google applications

Data studio is integrated into bitquery
Dashboard can be created by templates and link a data source

### Terraform Fundamentals
Terraform is a tool for building, changing, and versioning infrastructure safely and efficiently. Terraform can manage existing, popular service providers and custom in-house solutions.

Configuration files describe to Terraform the components needed to run a single application or your entire data center. Terraform generates an execution plan describing what it will do to reach the desired state, and then executes it to build the described infrastructure. As the configuration changes, Terraform can determine what changed and create incremental execution plans that can be applied.

Terraform can manage both low-level components such as compute instances, storage, and networking, and high-level components such as DNS entries and SaaS features.
